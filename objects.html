    <h1>Objects and Internal Representation in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, and objects play a crucial role in its design. In this blog post, we'll explore the concept of objects and their internal representation in JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Objects</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. Keys, also known as properties, are strings or symbols, and values can be of any data type, including other objects. Objects are used to represent and organize data in a structured way.</p>

    <h2>Internal Representation</h2>
    <p>The internal representation of objects in JavaScript involves a combination of properties and an internal prototype link. Each object has a hidden link to another object called its prototype. This forms a prototype chain, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.</p>

    <p>The internal structure of an object can be inspected using the <code>typeof</code> operator and the <code>Object.keys()</code> method. Additionally, the <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames()</code> method can be used to retrieve all properties, including non-enumerable ones.</p>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <pre>
<code>
// Creating an object
let person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        console.log('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
    }
};

// Accessing properties
console.log(person.name); // John
console.log(person['age']); // 30

// Calling a method
person.greet(); // Hello, John!
</code>
</pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Objects are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, offering a powerful way to structure and organize data. Understanding their internal representation helps developers make effective use of objects in their code.</p>
