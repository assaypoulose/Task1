    <h1>Understanding IP Addresses, Ports, HTTP Methods, and MAC Addresses</h1>

    <p>In the world of computer networking, several key concepts play a crucial role in facilitating communication and data exchange. Let's delve into the fundamentals of IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, and MAC addresses.</p>

    <h2>1. IP Addresses</h2>
    <p>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network. It serves two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing. IP addresses can be IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).</p>

    <h2>2. Ports</h2>
    <p>Ports are used to differentiate multiple services running on the same device. They are like doors through which data flows into and out of a computer. Ports are identified by numbers ranging from 0 to 65535. Commonly used ports include 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and 22 for SSH.</p>

    <h2>3. HTTP Methods</h2>
    <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods define the actions that can be performed on resources identified by a URL. Common HTTP methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GET:</strong> Retrieve data from the server</li>
        <li><strong>POST:</strong> Send data to be processed by the server</li>
        <li><strong>PUT:</strong> Update a resource on the server</li>
        <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Remove a resource from the server</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. MAC Addresses</h2>
    <p>A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller for communications on a network segment. It is a hardware address and is typically expressed as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, and MAC addresses is fundamental for anyone working in the field of computer networking. These concepts form the backbone of communication protocols that enable the internet and local networks to function seamlessly.</p>
