    <h1>Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h1>
    <p>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that are used for communication on the World Wide Web. Here are some key differences between them:</p>

    <h2>1. Multiplexing</h2>
    <p>HTTP/1.1: Uses a single connection per request, leading to potential head-of-line blocking issues.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2: Introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent and received in parallel over a single connection, improving performance.</p>

    <h2>2. Binary Protocol</h2>
    <p>HTTP/1.1: Text-based protocol, which can be less efficient in terms of parsing and transmission.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2: Binary protocol, which reduces overhead and is more efficient for both the client and server.</p>

    <h2>3. Header Compression</h2>
    <p>HTTP/1.1: Headers are sent in plaintext, leading to higher overhead.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2: Utilizes header compression, reducing the amount of data sent over the network and improving performance.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While HTTP/1.1 has been widely used, HTTP/2 introduces several improvements that enhance web performance. The choice between them depends on factors such as server and client support, as well as specific use cases.</p>
